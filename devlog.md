# Development Log

This file tracks the development history, design decisions, and implementation details of the HN MCP project.

## How to use this file

When making significant changes to the codebase:

1. Document your changes in the appropriate section below
2. Add a new entry in the "Recent Changes" section with today's date and a summary
3. Be detailed about design decisions, implementation choices, and reasons behind them
4. Include any challenges faced and how they were overcome

## Recent Changes

### 2025-05-05: Documentation Enhancement - Improved MCP Tool Documentation with Extensive Input/Output Examples

- Enhanced MCP tool documentation for better AI agent usability:
  - Added detailed descriptions for all Hacker News tools explaining functionality and use cases
  - Clarified that "HN" is the common abbreviation for "Hacker News" throughout the documentation
  - Expanded parameter descriptions with examples and usage guidelines
  - Added comprehensive input/output examples showing exact tool invocations and corresponding results
  - Included realistic story examples with titles, URLs, scores, and comment counts
  - Added specific parameter value examples showing effects (e.g., count=3 vs count=25)
  - Clarified output format information in tool descriptions
  - Ensured documentation communicates sorting behavior (by score in descending order)
  - Added cross-referencing between tools (e.g., using IDs from listings in the story_by_id function)

### 2025-04-24: Performance Improvements - Added LRU Cache for Story Retrieval

- Implemented LRU cache for Hacker News stories to reduce API requests:
  - Added lru-rs crate for efficient caching
  - Created CachedStory wrapper to store story data
  - Modified story retrieval process to check cache before making API calls
  - Added cache hit/miss logging for monitoring performance

### 2025-04-24: Code Quality Improvements

- Fixed Clippy warnings throughout the codebase:
  - Removed unused imports in `src/tools/hn/mod.rs`
  - Replaced manual `min/max` clamping with `clamp()` method for cleaner code
  - Added `Default` implementation for `HnClient`
  - Simplified redundant closure in map function

## Architecture

The HN MCP follows a clean architecture pattern with the following components:

- Client layer: Handles communication with the Hacker News API
- Router layer: Routes MCP requests to appropriate handlers
- Server layer: Manages the MCP protocol and communication

## Implementation Details

### Hacker News Client

The HnClient is implemented as a wrapper around the newswrap crate's HackerNewsClient.
It provides methods to:

- Fetch various story categories (top, latest, best, ask, show)
- Get story details by ID
- Process stories in parallel batches for better performance

### Concurrency Model

We use Tokio for asynchronous processing and concurrent fetching of story details.
Stories are processed in configurable chunks (default 5, max 10) to avoid overwhelming the API.

## Future Improvements

- ✅ Add caching to reduce API calls for frequently requested stories
- ✅ Improve tool documentation for better AI agent interaction
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Add error retry logic for transient API failures
- Expand test coverage for edge cases
- Add support for more advanced search parameters
- Add comment retrieval functionality for story discussions
